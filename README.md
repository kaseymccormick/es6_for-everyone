# ES6 for Everyone
Is a video learning series I purchased to learn more about ES6, created by Wes Bos and available at ->  . 
This repository is my collection of notes and files while going through the course as I tend not to remember until I write something down. There are 66 videos/steps that range in time from two minutes to 10 minutes.
